# What is in the fridge? 🍽️

Flutter project using Riverpod for state management.
The idea of the application was to solve a problem I faced after going to work in an area without my family. Its purpose is to see what's in the fridge and when it's expected to expire.
And it works on all platforms (Mobile: Android, IOS - PC: Windows, Linux, Mac - Web). 📱💻🌐

The advanced topics were learned in Filter, specifically (Riverpod) during a two-day course at the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the [course](https://twitter.com/Attaa_SA) /status/1590089587048652800) was presented by [Eng. Mouaz M AlShahmeh](https://github.com/Eng-Mouaz-M-AlShahmeh) with the Attaa Digital Initiative.

I have a lot of ideas I intend to implement myself and what I need without trying the current apps in the store at least in the initial stages.

## TODO
- [] Add Logo for app and description
- [] Add calendar select
- [] Use shared preferences

## Contributing
Of course, it is possible by making a fork, adding the feature or modifying it, and making a pull request.

This project is the first application in a public for Flutter, and I seek to continuously develop it during the holidays so that I can use and help me Insha'Allah.
Fun fact 😃: The project was uploaded to GitHub during the holiday due to the Saudi League over Argentina in their first World Cup match 2022.
